# Assign-1
Your Project's Name
Starting off, the purpose of this project is a personal branding website for future potential employers that will essentially view my website and decide if they would like to hire me after viewing my portfolio/resume. My project's name is ID_S10208584_Assignment1.
The naming convention for all my files are detailed such that they are easy to recognize.

Design Process
To repeat, it is for employers to view and hire me. I have made my website such that personal information about myself can be easily viewed such as my education, work experience et cetera. To add on, these informations are easily accessible on the navigation bar on the top of the page be it in mobile or desktop view. From a user/employer's point of view, upon first click onto the website, they would be greeted with a picture of myself and a small text containing "Welcome to my personal branding" this being the center of attention.


Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

To start off, The navigation bar is filled with different href that upon click will bring the user to different webpages depending on which information they wish to view about me. 
In the service webpage, the users are able to hover over the various services which are in a 'card' where  once hovered, there will be a slightly visible box shadow that changes colour to give it a pop out attribute.
In the contact information webpage, users are able to fill out their own personal particulars if they wish to contact me either about my webpage of a job contract. Inside the form users must fill out their particulars in accordance to the guidelines as shown in the placeholder text. They are unable to give nonsensical particulars due to the patterns that i have implemented in the contact number as well as the email textboxes.

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
